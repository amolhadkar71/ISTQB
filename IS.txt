##########TEST PLANNING AND CONTROL:###################

@@TEST PLANNING:
------------------
During test planning we make sure that we understand goals and objective of the customers,stakeholders and the project and the risk.
1.Determine the scope and risks and identify the objectives of testing
2.Determine the test approach
3.Implement the test policy and/or the test strategy
4.Determine the required test resources
5.Schedule test analysis and design tasks, test implementation, execution and evaluation
6.Determine the exit criteria

@@TEST CONTROL:
-----------------
It is an ongoing process where we compare the actual and expected progress.
1.Measure and analyze the results of reviews and testing
2.Monitor and document progress, test coverage and exit criteria
3.Provide information on testing
4.Initiate corrective actions
5.Make decisions


###########TEST ANALYSIS AND DESIGN:##############
It is a activity where testing objectives are transformed into tangible test conditions and test design.
(test designs and procedures)
1.Review the test basis
2.Identify test conditions based on analysis of test items, their specifications
3.Design the tests
4.Evaluate testability of the requirements and system.
5.Design the test environment set-up and identify any required infrastructure and tools



################TEST IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION################
During test implementation and execution we take the test condn and make them into test cases and testware and set up the environment.

Implementation:
1.Develop and prioritize our test cases.
2.Creating test suites from the test cases for efficient test execution.
3.Implement and verify the environment.


####################EVALUATING EXIT CRITERIA AND REPORTING#########################
Evaluating exit criteria is the activity where test execution is assessed against the defined objectives.
1.Check test logs against the exit criteria specified in test planning
2.Assess if more tests are needed or if the exit criteria specified should be changed
3.Write a test summary report for stakeholders





########################TEST CLOSURE ACTIVITIES###########################
During test closure activities, we collect data from completed test activities to consolidate experience, including checking and filing testware, and analyzing facts and numbers.
1.Check which planned deliverables we actually delivered and ensure all incident reports
2.Finalize and archive testware
3.Hand over testware to the maintenance organization
4.Evaluate how the testing went and analyze lessons learned for future releases and projects
